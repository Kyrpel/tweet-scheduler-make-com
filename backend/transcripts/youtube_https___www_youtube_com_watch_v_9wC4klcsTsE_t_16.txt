                Transcript:
                Violations arise related to the disclosures under both S.A.S.V. 123R and Internal Revenue Code Section 409A. You forgot about the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 02? Statute of Limitations renders Sarbanes-Oxley moot post-2007. And not if you can find actions to cover up the violation as established in the Sixth Circuit May 2008. That's oppressive, but you're at a computer. I'm playing hearts. If you want to beat me, you're going to have to do it at something else. I'm sorry. I need an adult. If you give me this, I will work as hard as it takes to school those Harvard douches and become the best lawyer you have ever seen. I'm inclined to give you a shot. What if I decide to go another way? I'd say that's fine. Sometimes I like to hang out with people who aren't that bright, too. Just to see how the other half lives. Move over. I'm emailing the firm I found our next associate.
