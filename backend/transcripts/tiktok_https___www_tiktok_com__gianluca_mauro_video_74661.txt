                I knew that OpenAI was not going to wait long before giving an answer to the whole deep sick chaos. And here it is, O3 Mini. What is special about this model? It's a reasoning model, and it's either the same or more powerful than O1, the most powerful model that OpenAI had, but that's not the most important thing. The most important thing is how efficient this model is. It's so efficient, they can add it to the free plan, so you can use it for free. But if you want to pay for the API, which is a good indication of how cheap it is for them to run, it's 12 times cheaper than O1, which confirms something I've been saying for a long time. And people always get angry at me when I say that, because they think it's crazy. AI will be free. AI is the fastest depreciating asset in history. OpenAI itself, the market leader, even before deep sick, was making their own prices tank, reducing the cost of their API by 95% in a year and a half. Tell me another company that's a market leader does something like this. Everybody, open source, competition is pushing the cost of AI to zero marginal cost. Expect AI to be everywhere. By the way, since this app might disappear, what about an insurance policy? Follow me on Instagram so you keep staying in touch and keep learning about AI.
